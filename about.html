        <h2>CAMBODIA CUISINE STYLE</h2>
        <p>
          Cambodian cuisine has a long history and a diverse range of
          influences, yet it’s only now becoming known beyond the country’s
          borders. In fact, the only place you can experience all it has to
          offer is in the country itself. Here are some of the best dishes to
          try.

          Nom banh chok is a beloved Cambodian dish, so much so that in English
          it’s sometimes called simply “Khmer noodles.” It’s a typical breakfast
          food, and every morning you’ll find it being sold by women carrying
          baskets of fresh rice noodles hanging from a pole balanced on their
          shoulders. The dish consists of fresh noodles laboriously pounded out
          of rice, topped with a fish-based green curry gravy made from
          lemongrass, fingerroot ginger, turmeric, and garlic. Fresh cucumbers,
          banana flower, long beans, edible flowers, and wild leaves are heaped
          on top. In Siem Reap, it is served with a sweet sauce called tuk paem
          made from palm sugar and peanuts.<br /><br />Amok is one of the
          best-known Cambodian dishes, but you’ll find similar meals in
          neighboring countries. The addition of slok ngor, a local herb that
          imparts a subtly bitter flavor, separates the Cambodian version from
          the rest of the pack.The curry is made with fresh coconut milk and
          kroeung. Traditionally the dish was made with either fish or snails,
          but now you can find chicken and even vegetarian versions. At upscale
          restaurants amok is steamed with egg in a banana leaf for a
          mousse-like texture, while more homestyle places serve a boiled
          version that is more like a soupy fish curry.

          <br /><br />After rice, the most important ingredient in Cambodian
          cuisine is prahok, a mash of salty fermented fish. It’s added in small
          quantities to bring an umami kick to many dishes, but in prahok ktis
          it has the starring role. Cooked with fresh coconut cream, palm sugar,
          and minced pork, the pungent prahok becomes mild enough for even
          trepidatious visitors to enjoy. Another version of the dish, prahok
          kroeung ktis, adds a fragrant paste of root spices. Both are served
          with crunchy fresh vegetables.

        <h2>BEST THING TO DO IN CAMBODIA</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the world’s most popular attractions, a history fraught with
          tragedy, and a chance to enjoy a leisurely pace of life away from the
          hustle and bustle of the big towns – that’s Cambodia for you. The best
          time to visit Cambodia is in the winter months with cooler
          temperatures and sunny days, perfect for exploring ancient temples and
          ruins, taking river cruises or lazing on gorgeous beaches. There are a
          wealth of experiences on offer in one of Southeast Asia‘s most popular
          destinations: visiting the temple complex of Angkor Wat, a stunning
          remnant of the Khmer empire, understanding Cambodian history in Phnom
          Penh, or relaxing on the beaches of Sihanoukville. You could be
          enjoying a sunset over the Mekong in Kratie, exploring the Bokor
          National Park, unwinding in the island paradise of Koh Rong, and
          discovering the pepper plantations and night markets of Kampot. Learn
          the intricacies of Khmer cuisine in a cooking class at Siem Reap. As
          you start planning for an unforgettable vacation, also take a look at
