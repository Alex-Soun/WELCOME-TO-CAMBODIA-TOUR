            Discover Cambodia beyond Angkor Wat <br /><br />
            Some of the world’s most popular attractions, a history fraught with
            tragedy, and a chance to enjoy a leisurely pace of life away from
            the hustle and bustle of the big towns – that’s Cambodia for you.
            The best time to visit Cambodia is in the winter months with cooler
            temperatures and sunny days, perfect for exploring ancient temples
            and ruins, taking river cruises or lazing on gorgeous beaches. There
            are a wealth of experiences on offer in one of Southeast Asia‘s most
            popular destinations: visiting the temple complex of Angkor Wat, a
            stunning remnant of the Khmer empire, understanding Cambodian
            history in Phnom Penh, or relaxing on the beaches of Sihanoukville.
            You could be enjoying a sunset over the Mekong in Kratie, exploring
            the Bokor National Park, unwinding in the island paradise of Koh
            Rong, and discovering the pepper plantations and night markets of
            Kampot. Learn the intricacies of Khmer cuisine in a cooking class at
            Siem Reap. As you start planning for an unforgettable vacation, also
